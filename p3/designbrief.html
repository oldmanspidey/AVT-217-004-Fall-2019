<h2><u><strong>Design Brief and your site content</strong></u></h2>
</p>

<h3>Brief</h3>

<p>The site will be split into two main sections. These sections will be delineated on the landing page of the website. One section will focus on any creative projects that result in a tangible end product, like a png of pixel art, a photograph of a painting, or a link to a video, for just a few examples.</p>

<p>The other section will focus on my management positions and contributions to less tangible end products. Things like irl events and broad branding and social media decisions can't really be summed up by presenting a single file.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, the website will likely be reminiscent of my second option for Project 1, going for a scapbook-like feel, but opting for more modern textures and typefaces instead.</p>
